[CHEAT_NAME] | [AFFECTS] | [PROPERTIES] 
-------
[CHEAT_NAME] - THE NAME OF THE CHEAT
[AFFECTS] - WHO THE CHEAT AFFECTS
PLR=PLAYER OPN=OPPONENT BTH=BOTH
[PROPERTIES] - WHAT THE CHEAT DOES
+N ADDS | -N SUBTRACTS | /N DIVIDES | *N MULTIPLIES | =N SETS
SWP SWAPS | INV INVERTS | RST RESETS
-------
[EXAMPLE | BOTH | +1 | SWP 
THIS CHEAT WOULD ADD 1 TO BOTH SCORES AND THEN SWAP THEM
```
