## INTRO

Ch33ter is a cross-platform terminal game written in C (99).

    YOU WILL BE CHALLENGED IN A GAME SOMETHING
    LIKE WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL '21'.
    HERE, THE GOAL IS TO REACH 33 WITHOUT GOING OVER.
    AND WE PLAY WITH CUSTOM DICE!
    YOUR OPPONENTS WILL BE MANY. SOME WILL BE
    STRONG SOME WILL BE WEAK.
    THEY WILL BRING THEIR OWN DICE. YOU MUST ACCOUNT FOR THAT.
    THE BEST WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT MIGHT BE CHEATING...
    
    GOOD LUCK!

```
[CHEAT_NAME] | [AFFECTS] | [PROPERTIES] 
-------
[CHEAT_NAME] - THE NAME OF THE CHEAT
[AFFECTS] - WHO THE CHEAT AFFECTS
PLR=PLAYER OPN=OPPONENT BTH=BOTH
[PROPERTIES] - WHAT THE CHEAT DOES
+N ADDS | -N SUBTRACTS | /N DIVIDES | *N MULTIPLIES | =N SETS
SWP SWAPS | INV INVERTS | RST RESETS
-------
[EXAMPLE | BOTH | +1 | SWP 
THIS CHEAT WOULD ADD 1 TO BOTH SCORES AND THEN SWAP THEM
```
